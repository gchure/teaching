# This script will simulate diffusion of a particle over time. While we can
# solve the diffusion equation analytically, this will serve as a fun way to
# learn how to write stochastic simulations.

# We'll begin by considering the diffusion of a single particle in one
# dimension. We will say that at any point in time, the particle has an equal
# probability of taking a step to the left as it can take a step to the right.
# Let's takea  look at the trajectory of a single particle.

# We'll seed the random number generator such that our results will be
# the same each time we run it.
#np.random.seed(42)

# Define the nubmer of steps the simulation will run.

# Define the stepping probability.
p = 0.5  # Equal probability of stepping right or left.

# We can simulate the random walk by flipping a coin at each step and testing
# its value with the probability.

# and see where it went.
